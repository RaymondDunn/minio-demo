# minio-demo
Testing ground for interacting with minio local S3-like object storage

# Included scripts
There are scripts here to upload and download individual tiff stacks to the minio server

D Docker
These test scripts assume you're running minio locally. For some quick configuration on that, see
See run-docker-minio.sh 
But really you're best off following minio's docker image resources.
